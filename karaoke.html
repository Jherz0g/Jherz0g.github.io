<p>I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord</p>
<p>And I've been waiting for this moment, for all my life, oh lord</p>
<p>Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord, oh lord</p>
<p>Well, if you told me you were drowning</p>
<p>I would not lend a hand</p>
<p>I've seen your face before my friend</p>
<p>But I don't know if you know who I am</p>
<p>Well, I was there and I saw what you did</p>
<p>I saw it with my own two eyes</p>
<p>So you can wipe off that grin, I know where you've been</p>
<p>It's all been a pack of lies</p>
<p>And I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord</p>
<p>Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord</p>
<p>I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord</p>
<p>Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord, oh lord</p>
<p>Well I remember, I remember don't worry</p>
<p>How could I ever forget</p>
<p>It's the first time, the last time we ever met</p>
<p>But I know the reason why you keep this silence up</p>
<p>No you don't fool me</p>
<p>The hurt doesn't show, but the pain still grows</p>
<p>It's no stranger to you and me</p>
<p>I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord</p>
<p>Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord</p>
<p>I can feel it in the air tonight, oh lord, oh lord</p>
<p>Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord</p>
<p>I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh lord</p>
<p>I can feel it in the air tonight, oh lord, oh lord</p>
<p>Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord, oh lord</p>
<p>I can feel it in the air tonight, oh lord, oh lord</p>
<p>Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh lord, oh lord</p>
