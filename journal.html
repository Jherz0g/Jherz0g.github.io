	- 11/28/21 <br>
	- Sunday <br><br>
	Today I created my journal page. I will begin to post my coding journey on this page, so make sure to check my future entries!
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	- 12/4/21 <br>
	- Saturday <br><br>
	Today, I worked on my New Year's Project. It is a background of a beach with the words "Happy New Year" in it. There is also a dancing cartoon animal. It was a fun project to make because I had to play around with the position of the text and pictures.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	- 12/7/21 <br>
	- Monday <br><br>
	Today, I worked on and finshed my "How it Works" presentation. I chose the topic of 'Sneaker Bots' as they are a rising concern in the retail buisness. I learned the basics about these bots, as well as the ways that they avoid being detected by anti-bot programming.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>

	- Tuesday <br><br>
	Today I had a lab with Molly where we went over functions and animations on CSS. I started to make a project in which a football player dives out to make a catch using animations. This project will hopefully be completed soon.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	- 1/19/22 <br>
	- Wednesday <br><br>
	Today I had a lab with Molly and she taught me how to make a variable in Javascript. I learned how to mke a random variable with emojis.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	- 1/26/22 <br>
	- Wednesday <br><br>
	Today I had a lab woth Molly and we experimented and created a function where different color squares appeared when my mouse moved to different pixels. Still a work in progress, though. It was interesting learning different parts of a function that are more complex than the ones we learned about in class.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	- 2/4/22 <br>
	- Friday <br><br>
	Today I finshed up my Valentine's Day Project and pushed it online. In the project, I made a function in javascript that changes the middle picture when I scroll over it.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	- 2/10/22 <br>
	- Thursday <br><br>
	Today, Priester and I presented our presentation on reveal.js. It was a presentation about our coding projects that we created in January. I created the Valentines Day project and the American Flag Squares project (both of which are on my projects page) and Priester created his own Valentines Day project as well as a Seahawks Player Generator. We collaborate very well on this project, as we explored this type of code and eventually made our first presentation. It was an overall great experience.

	- 2/26/22 <br>
	- Saturday <br><br>
	Today, I sat down and worked on the Digital Appreciation Project for nearly 2 hours. I made it for my brother. We play a video game called Rocket League togther, so I made an animation where I pass tha ball to him and he scores. Also, when you click on the screen, it shows text. I also strengthened my understanding of javascript.
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	- 3/10/22 <br>
	- Thursday <br><br>
	In class, we had to write down 10 questions about javascript and put them in out journal. Here they are:<br>
	1. What does it mean to "call", "run", and "write" a function?<br>
	2. What are all of the eventListeners (mouseover, click, etc.)?<br>
	3. What is appendChild?<br>
	4. What is the difference between () and {}?<br>
	5. Where is/are the input(s) and output(s) of a function?<br>
	6. Does "var x =" have a specific meaning?<br>
	7. How do you incorporate a Div into a function?<br>
	8. How do I make a function that can generate a random song?<br>
	9. How do you declare a variable outside vs. inside a function?<br>
	10. How do you use a conditional statement?
	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	- 4/10/22 <br>
	- Sunday <br><br>
	Today, I finished up my Patrick Project where patricks move around the screen every 2 seconds, and when you click on one it disappears and makes a sound. I used an event listener to listen for the click, which then played the audio file when clicked. I also used a div generator to keep creating divs of patrick every few seconds. There was also a function that counted how many patricks were eliminated, and went up by 1 for every patrick eliminated. I started this in class on 4/7, and finished it up on the weekend. I enjoyed making this because it was fun to put the pictures and sounds in the project.
