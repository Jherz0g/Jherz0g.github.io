	- Thanksgiving Day! <br><br>

	Today is Thanksgiving, and I am going to see my extended family and watch football. I cannot eat much, as I have just gotten my 4 wisdom teeth removed. I've been eating Jell-o and yogurt for the past day, and I can't wait until I can eat real food again.

	- Sunday (NFL Week 12) <br><br>
	Today is a normal Sunday. I woke up at 12:30, got breakfast ready, and turned on Sunday NFL Countdown. At 1:00, I turned on NFL Redzone and watched 7 hours of commercial-free football. 2 of my 3 fantasy teams did well, as those 2 teams over-performed. As for the other team, they sucked. It was a great day watching football.

	- Saturday <br><br>
	Today, I worked on my New Year's Project. It is a background of a beach with the words "Happy New Year" in it. There is also a dancing cartoon animal. It was a fun project to make because I had to play around with the position of the text and pictures.

	- Monday <br><br>
	Today, I worked on and finshed my "How it Works" presentation. I chose the topic of 'Sneaker Bots' as they are a rising concern in the retail buisness. I learned the basics about these bots, as well as the ways that they avoid being detected by anti-bot programming.

	- Tuesday <br><br>
	Today I had a lab with Molly where we went over functions and animations on CSS. I started to make a project in which a football player dives out to make a catch using animations. This will hopefully be completed soon, as I have high hopes for this project.
