	- 11/25/21 <br>
	- Thanksgiving Day! <br>
	- One Day After I got my wisdom teeth out <br><br>
	Today is Thanksgiving, and I am going to see my extended family and watch football. I cannot eat much, as I have just gotten my 4 wisdom teeth removed. I've been eating Jell-o and yogurt for the past day, and I can't wait until I can eat real food again.

	- Sunday (NFL Week 12) <br><br>
	Today is a normal Sunday. I woke up at 12:30, got breakfast ready, and turned on Sunday NFL Countdown. At 1:00, I turned on NFL Redzone and watched 7 hours of commercial-free football. 2 of my 3 fantasy teams did well, as those 2 temas over-performed. As for the other team, they sucked. It was a great day watching football.
